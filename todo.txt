####PhoneGap Client Side####
* Tweak colors on icon
* Periodically check the server to pull down updates.  Note that changes need to be pushed for any user that can view the list.
  * https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/channel/?hl=en&csw=1

* Figure out why beforepageload won't trigger on index.html when it's not loaded first.
* Need to add copyright and license info to every file?
* update intro page with info, link to github, IN PROGRESS, etc
* Option to share particular lists with other users,
  * Add support for read-only mode.
  * Maybe don't display shared lists until user accepts them?  Allow user to hide/unaccept other shared list so it doesn't clutter their screen
  * When list is shared, notify of change from server
  
  
* Add option to store a note with items
* refactor all my javascript to be in L123 namespace.
  
* Add delete options
* Add default list of items for auto-suggest
* Add auto-suggest from hidden options.
* Add rename/delete dialog.
* Add uncheck-all option (ask if should uncheck for just the selected stores or all stores)
* Implement item configuration update
  * Count, custom amount text.  "+" "-" "Custom" instead of More/Less.  +/- greyed out if non-numeric "Custom" entered
* Finish category maintenance
* Add auto-suggest of items from standard list + deleted items
* Add rename of categories
* Add category items page where you can select a category then check off all items that belong in that store
* Add location (subcategory) options inside stores
* In location config, add page where you can check off all items from that store that belong in that location
* Support multiple locations, or just single?
* Replace error alerts with dialogs
* Add SyncML layer, or rework to be more granular and more parsimonious of bandwidth.
  * Add partial sync, so you can push changes for only one list?
* Add ability to send list as email
* Add manual ordering/reordering
* Option to use location services to figure out what store you're at?
* Options where you can turn that feature on/off.
* Add logout option
* Option to remember me.
** Server option to log out all remembered logins.
* Option to import/export from csv file.
* Ads
* Better colors/some graphics
* Need a way to log remember login or not, at least on the web version.
  * If remembering, add a logout button.
  * If not remembering, don't store data in localStorage.

* Adjust to add features for larger screens (option to display categories inline?)

#### Implement server side ####
  * Handle added something whose name matches something that already exists.
    * e.g. add foo list on client A, but don't sync, add foo list on client B and sync.  When A syncs, it should just merge the 2 Foo lists...  
  * Add abstraction layer around Google-specific code, in case I want to move it
  * Implement OpenID
  * Convert all direct field access to getter/setter
  * Add ability to upload list
  * Add ability to export list
  * Add ability to share/revoke share of list
    * As view-only
  * Add ability to share an link to a list that doesn't require login
    * As view-only
  * If an id is on the client side and not on the server side then replace it with a new unique id, even
    if it looks like a permanant ID.  Otherwise, one user could mess with someone else's lists.
  * Google ads

###Notes
Server need to store
  * users lists
      * other users allowed to see each list
  
    * user is entity (kind=user)
      * name: user email address
      * each list is a separate entity with ancestor of the owner:(kind=list)
        * name: from sharded unique ID generator
        * displayName: property of the user-defined list name
        * current selectedCategories (categories to display) is only stored on client?
        * lastUpdate: last update time property
        
        * each other user allowed to view the list is added with an ancestor of the list: (kind=other_user_list)
          * name: other user email address
          * lastUpdate: last update time property
          * privLevel: property with possible values VIEW or FULL
          
        * each category is separate entity with ancestor of the list (kind=category)
          * name: unique name from sharded unique ID generator
          * displayName: property of the user-defined category name
          * lastUpdate: last update time property
          
        * each item is a separate entity (kind=item)
          * displayName: property of the user-defined item name
          * count: property of the number of items desired
          * status: property with possible values ACTIVE | COMPLETED | DELETED
          * lastUpdate: last update time property
          
          * each category the item is configured with is set up as a separate entity (kind=itemCategory)
            * name: category sharded name
            * lastUpdate: last update time property
            * status: property with possible values ACTIVE | DELETED (so we can compare timestamp if category is removed then readded in conflict)
            
        
      
      * shard counters to create a unique identifier for all items we add.
      https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/sharding_counters
          e.g. entity1:1

* Given a user:
  * find their lists by looking up lists by the owner property.
  * find other user's lists they should be able to edit by looking up lists by other_user property (does this work with multiple values??)
  * Find who/what they granted privs to by looking up their lists and looking at the other_user property values
