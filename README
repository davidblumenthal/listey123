Listey is a general-purpose list tracking application.

Currently, it is using jQuery Mobile to render web pages
entirely from static HTML and javascript, and AJAX calls
to a Google App Engine page to allow synchronization.

This frontend is designed to drop into a PhoneGap install
for installing as a mobile app.
